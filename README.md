# FTPserver
Basic FTP-server that utilizes socket programming in C.

To run this program, compile it using the Makefile and type ./ftpserver port_number on the command line.

ftpserver.c is a server that sends a file specified by the client to that client.

I plan to write a client program later, but in the meantime, netcat can be used to test the program.
